Clash Scrims we love them!!

Here's some that we've done:



| WE | LOVE | SCRIMS |
| --- | :---: | ---: |
| col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is | centered | $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat | $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less | Pretty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Still | renders | nicely |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
