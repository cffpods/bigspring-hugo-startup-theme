Clash Scrims we love them!!

Here's some that we've done:

| WE | LOVE | SCRIMS |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [](/images/clashsports.jpg) | [](/images/banner-2.png) | [](/images/tyspurpteam2.jpg) |
| col 2 is | centered | $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat | $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less | Pretty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Still | renders | nicely |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
