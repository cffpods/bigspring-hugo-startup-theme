There are now more active Clash podcasts than ever. And weâ€™ve been busy listening to them, befriending their hosts and marveling at how cool and mutually supportive they all are. To celebrate this podcast renaissance, we hosted a mixer war in April 2021 to mingle with the hosts of the new generation of podcasts and their posses!

First was the LIVE DRAFT. where Karl of Crystal 2 Join drafted players for **Team Lit-er-al-ly** and Miss P of Married 2 Clash drafted for **Team Treat Yo Self**. You can hear how that played out on The Clash Files podcast feed here:

Then came the war which we were lucky to have livestreamed by our favorite streamer, [Mordzors](https://twitch.tv/mordzors). Pods and Wreck was a blast from start to finish! 

We can't thank our podcast friends enough for joining us and hyping us on their shows.
