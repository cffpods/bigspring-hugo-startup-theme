There are now more active Clash podcasts than ever. And weâ€™ve been busy listening to them, befriending their hosts and marveling at how cool and mutually supportive they all are. To celebrate this podcast renaissance, we hosted a mixer war in April 2021 to mingle with the hosts of the new generation of podcasts and their posses!

First was the LIVE DRAFT. where Karl of Crystal 2 Join drafted players for **Team Lit-er-al-ly** and Miss P of Married 2 Clash drafted for **Team Treat Yo Self**. You can hear how that played out on The Clash Files podcast feed or at the bottom of this page.

Then came the war which we were lucky to have livestreamed by our favorite streamer, [Mordzors](https://twitch.tv/mordzors). Pods and Wreck was a blast from start to finish! We can't thank our podcast friends enough for joining us and hyping us on their shows:

* [**Clash on the Poddy** ](https://anchor.fm/tj920/)discussed the TH14 war in [Episode 3 of Season 3](https://anchor.fm/tj920/episodes/S3-Ep-3-The-TH14-Only-War-and-the-Warden-Walk-Super-Archer-Attack-e10veb6)
