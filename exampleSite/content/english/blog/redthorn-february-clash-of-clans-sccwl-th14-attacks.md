The February season of Supercell's Clash of Clans War League (aka SCCWL or CWL) arrived and The Clash Files teams split into even more groups in order to accommodate the short season brought to us by SC. In this video by [MagnusGames](https://www.youtube.com/c/MagnusGames) you'll get to check out some of the super attacks brought to us by RedThorn!
