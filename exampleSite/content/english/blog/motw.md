**🙋 • • Member of the Week • • 🙋‍♂️**

"Member of the Week" is an event where our team of Family Leaders & Co-Leaders pick a Clash Files member to spotlight every week, from Friday to Friday. The featured member gets the 🍕Member of the Week role hoisted above members, a bot command of their username, and a shout-out in the 💖Member of the Week channel where they can be asked questions by the community AMA(ask me anything) style - or privately if preferred - so we can get to know them better! The very first MOTW Member of the Week was dlud, the "numbers guy" from Noble Hero!
