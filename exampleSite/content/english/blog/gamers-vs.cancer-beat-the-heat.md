**BEAT THE HEAT was such an amazing event!!**

Our original goal for this war was to raise $100 on [Tiltify](https://tiltify.com/+pods-and-wreck/podsnwreck-vs-cancer) to Wreck Cancer but we crushed it! We raised $430 for the American Cancer Society!! Thank you to all of the players, to [Mordzors](https://twitch.tv/mordzors) for a fantastic stream, and to everyone who generously donated for making this so successful.

A huge part of the success is thanks to our Supporters. Because of their Subscriptions to our Discord server, we were able to create extra challenges for players that earned bonus donations which pushed us over our goal. **Supporting us on Discord is even easier! Mobile users can now subscribe directly by using this link -** [**Clash Files Guardians**](https://discord.com/channels/101681392651362304/role-subscriptions)
