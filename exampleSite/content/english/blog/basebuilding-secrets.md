On June 9th 2021, Pineapples and Thorns hosted our very first DISCORD STAGE podcast with Andrew, one of Spacestation Gaming's pro base builders for their run for the 2021 Clash of Clans eSports World Championships. This show was such fun to put together, experience live, and listen to again later. We hope you enjoy it!
