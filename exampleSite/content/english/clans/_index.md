{{< faq "Do I need to be a Clash Files Family member to play in your Clash Scrims?" >}} Not at all! You don't need a special role or position to hang out with us and enjoy our events. You just need to sign up! Anyone in our Discord Server can participate in our events and chat in our channels. They're really fun and a great way to get to know everyone. [Click here](http://discord.gg/clashfiles) to join our Discord Community and view our calendar of events.  {{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "But what if I want to join a Clash Files clan? How do I do that?" >}} Every Clash Files clan chooses their own method of promoting their members. In general though - Elders are consistently active both in-game and in Discord, attack on time, help clanmates plan attacks, and are just all around fantastic members for an extended period of time. Co-Leaders have been outstanding Elders for a long time and have earned the clan leadership's trust.  {{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "How do I get promoted to Elder or Co-Leader?" >}} Every Clash Files clan chooses their own method of promoting their members. In general though - Elders are consistently active both in-game and in Discord, attack on time, help clanmates plan attacks, and are just all around fantastic members for an extended period of time. Co-Leaders have been outstanding Elders for a long time and have earned the clan leadership's trust.  {{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "How does the Clan Family stay so organized?" >}} We use [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) to communicate outside of the game. Each family clan has its own server and everyone congregates to socialize in the Clash Files Server. Our amazing group of Leaders and Co-Leaders also chat frequently to keep up to date on how everyone is doing. Want to chat with us?

{{< faq "How did The Clash Files become a Clan Family?" >}} ​Six years ago, four Clashers came together to create The Clash Files Podcast.​​ As the podcast became more popular, our membership grew so we created more clans to expand our family. Along the way we also held Clash of Clans and Clash Royale events, where we made some great friends - many of whom joined our clans with alt accounts! After playing in several Clash Scrims together and mingling in each other's chats for a long time, some of our Clash friends began to feel like family, so we invited them to join us. ​ {{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "How can my clan join The Clash Files Family?" >}} In general we do not actively recruit for clans. We are very proud to be a close knit **family** not an alliance, and have had our strong, drama-free bonds for over six years because **we are very selective in who we ask to join us**. When considering an addition to the family, we first look at clans led by long-time Clash Files members who have clans of their own. After that, we might look to our Discord server members who - along with their clan's members - have participated in multiple events and actively chatted with us over a long period of time. Essentially we are looking for groups of people that _act like family_ before we consider asking them to officially _become_ family. {{</ faq >}}
